      "'drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained'\n",
      "'reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely'\n",

      "'yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene'\n",
      "'Adler, of dubious and questionable memory.'\n",
      "'I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away'\n",
      "'from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred'\n",
      "'interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master'\n",
      "'of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention,'\n",
      "'while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian'\n",
      "'soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old'\n",
      "'books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition,'\n",
      "'the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen'\n",
      "'nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime,'\n",
      "'and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of'\n",
      "'observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those'\n",
      "'mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police.'\n",
      "'From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his'\n",
      "'summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up'\n",
      "'of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and'\n",
      "'finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and'\n",
      "'successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of'\n",
      "'his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of'\n",
      "'the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion.'\n",
      "'One night—it was on the twentieth of March, 1888—I was returning from a'\n",
      "'journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when'\n",
      "'my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered'\n",
      "'door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and'\n",
      "'with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a'\n",
      "'keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his'\n",
      "'extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I'\n",
      "'looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette'\n",
      "'against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his'\n",
      "'head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who'\n",
      "'knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own'\n",
      "'story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created'\n",
      "'dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell'\n",
      "'and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own.'\n",
      "'His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think,'\n",
      "'to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved'\n",
      "'me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a'\n",
      "'spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire'\n",
      "'and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion.'\n",
      "'“Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put'\n",
      "'on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.”'\n",
      "'“Seven!” I answered.'\n",
      "'“Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I'\n",
      "'fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me'\n",
      "'that you intended to go into harness.”'\n",
      "'“Then, how do you know?”'\n",
      "'“I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting'\n",
      "'yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless'\n",
      "'servant girl?”'\n",
      "'“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have'\n",
      "'been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a'\n",
      "'country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I'\n",
      "'have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary'\n",
      "'Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there,'\n",
      "'again, I fail to see how you work it out.”'\n",

      "'“It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside'\n",
      "'of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is'\n",
      "'scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by'\n",
      "'someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in'\n",
      "'order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double'\n",

      "'particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As'\n",
      "'to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of'\n",
      "'iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right'\n",

      "'he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not'\n",
      "'pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.”'\n",
      "'I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his'\n",
      "'process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked,'\n",
      "'“the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I'\n",
      "'could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your'\n",
      "'reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I'\n",
      "'believe that my eyes are as good as yours.”'\n",
      "'“Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself'\n",
      "'down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The'\n",
      "'distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps'\n",
      "'which lead up from the hall to this room.”'\n",
      "'“Frequently.”'\n",
      "'“How often?”'\n",
      "'“Well, some hundreds of times.”'\n",
      "'“Then how many are there?”'\n",
      "'“How many? I don’t know.”'\n",
      "'“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just'\n",
      "'my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have'\n",
      "'both seen and observed. By the way, since you are interested in these'\n",
      "'little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two'\n",
      "'of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw'\n",
      "'over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted notepaper which had been lying open'\n",
      "'upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.”'\n",
      "'The note was undated, and without either signature or address.'\n",
      "'“There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it'\n",
      "'said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very'\n",
      "'deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of'\n",
      "'Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with'\n",
      "'matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated.'\n",
      "'This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your'\n",
      "'chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor'\n",
      "'wear a mask.”'\n",
      "'“This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it'\n",
      "'means?”'\n",
      "'“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorise before one has'\n",
      "'data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of'\n",
      "'theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from'\n",
      "'it?”'\n",
      "'I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was'\n",
      "'written.'\n",
      "'“The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked,'\n",
      "'endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not'\n",
      "'be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and'\n",
      "'stiff.”'\n",
      "'“Peculiar—that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English'\n",
      "'paper at all. Hold it up to the light.”'\n",
      "'I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G”'\n",
      "'with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper.'\n",
      "'“What do you make of that?” asked Holmes.'\n",
      "'“The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.”'\n",
      "'“Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’'\n",
      "'which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like'\n",
      "'our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us'\n",
      "'glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume'\n",
      "'from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a'\n",
      "'German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable'\n",
      "'as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous'\n",
      "'glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of'\n",
      "'that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud'\n",
      "'from his cigarette.'\n",
      "'“The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said.'\n",
      "'“Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the'\n",
      "'peculiar construction of the sentence—‘This account of you we have from'\n",
      "'all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written'\n",
      "'that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only'\n",
      "'remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who'\n",
      "'writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his'\n",
      "'face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our'\n",
      "'doubts.”'\n",
      "'As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating'\n",
      "'wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes'\n",
      "'whistled.'\n",
      "'“A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of'\n",
      "'the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred'\n",

      "'the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or'\n",
      "'conversations in it, “and what is the use of a book,” thought Alice'\n",
      "'“without pictures or conversations?”'\n",
      "'So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the'\n",
      "'hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure of'\n",
      "'making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and'\n",
      "'picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran'\n",
      "'close by her.'\n",
      "'There was nothing so _very_ remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it'\n",
      "'so _very_ much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, “Oh'\n",
      "'dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!” (when she thought it over afterwards,'\n",
      "'it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the'\n",
      "'time it all seemed quite natural); but when the Rabbit actually _took a'\n",
      "'watch out of its waistcoat-pocket_, and looked at it, and then hurried'\n",
      "'on, Alice started to her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she'\n",
      "'had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a'\n",
      "'watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the'\n",

      "'dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think'\n",
      "'about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very'\n",
      "'deep well.'\n",
      "'Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she had'\n",
      "'plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what'\n",
      "'was going to happen next. First, she tried to look down and make out'\n",
      "'what she was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything; then she'\n",
      "'looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with'\n",
      "'cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she saw maps and pictures'\n",
      "'hung upon pegs. She took down a jar from one of the shelves as she'\n",
      "'passed; it was labelled “ORANGE MARMALADE”, but to her great'\n",
      "'disappointment it was empty: she did not like to drop the jar for fear'\n",
      "'of killing somebody underneath, so managed to put it into one of the'\n",
      "'cupboards as she fell past it.'\n",
      "'“Well!” thought Alice to herself, “after such a fall as this, I shall'\n",
      "'think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they’ll all think me'\n",
      "'at home! Why, I wouldn’t say anything about it, even if I fell off the'\n",
      "'top of the house!” (Which was very likely true.)'\n",
      "'Down, down, down. Would the fall _never_ come to an end? “I wonder how'\n",
      "'many miles I’ve fallen by this time?” she said aloud. “I must be'\n",
      "'getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. Let me see: that would'\n",
      "'be four thousand miles down, I think—” (for, you see, Alice had learnt'\n",
      "'several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom, and'\n",
      "'though this was not a _very_ good opportunity for showing off her'\n",
      "'knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her, still it was good'\n",
      "'practice to say it over) “—yes, that’s about the right distance—but'\n",
      "'then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude I’ve got to?” (Alice had no'\n",
      "'idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice'\n",
      "'grand words to say.)'\n",
      "'Presently she began again. “I wonder if I shall fall right _through_'\n",
      "'the earth! How funny it’ll seem to come out among the people that walk'\n",
      "'with their heads downward! The Antipathies, I think—” (she was rather'\n",
      "'glad there _was_ no one listening, this time, as it didn’t sound at all'\n",
      "'the right word) “—but I shall have to ask them what the name of the'\n",

      "'to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.”'\n",
      "'Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began'\n",

      "'sometimes, “Do bats eat cats?” for, you see, as she couldn’t answer'\n",

      "'“Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?” when suddenly,'\n",
      "'thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and'\n",

      "'Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:'\n",

      "'turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found'\n",
      "'herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging'\n",
      "'from the roof.'\n",
      "'There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when'\n",
      "'Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every'\n",

      "'get out again.'\n",
      "'Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid'\n",
      "'glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice’s'\n",
      "'first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall;'\n",
      "'but, alas! either the locks were too large, or the key was too small,'\n",
      "'but at any rate it would not open any of them. However, on the second'\n",
      "'time round, she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before, and'\n",
      "'behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high: she tried the'\n",
      "'little golden key in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!'\n",
      "'Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not'\n",
      "'much larger than a rat-hole: she knelt down and looked along the'\n",
      "'passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw. How she longed to get'\n",
      "'out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright'\n",
      "'flowers and those cool fountains, but she could not even get her head'\n",
      "'through the doorway; “and even if my head would go through,” thought'\n",
      "'poor Alice, “it would be of very little use without my shoulders. Oh,'\n",
      "'how I wish I could shut up like a telescope! I think I could, if I only'\n",
      "'knew how to begin.” For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had'\n",
      "'happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things'\n",
      "'indeed were really impossible.'\n",
      "'There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she went'\n",
      "'back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on it, or at'\n",
      "'any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this'\n",
      "'time she found a little bottle on it, (“which certainly was not here'\n",
      "'before,” said Alice,) and round the neck of the bottle was a paper'\n",
      "'label, with the words “DRINK ME,” beautifully printed on it in large'\n",
      "'letters.'\n",
      "'It was all very well to say “Drink me,” but the wise little Alice was'\n",
      "'not going to do _that_ in a hurry. “No, I’ll look first,” she said,'\n",
