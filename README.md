# 🧠 RAG-hands-on

A practical hands-on repository for exploring Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using open-source tools and LLMs.

---

## ✅ What Has Been Done So Far

- ✅ Environment setup completed (`env-setup/`)
- ✅ Installed and configured necessary libraries (e.g., `transformers`, `faiss`, `langchain`, `llama-cpp`)
- ✅ Added quantized model support using `bitsandbytes` for 4-bit/8-bit loading
- ✅ Implemented document ingestion pipeline:
  - Document loading
  - Chunking using LangChain
  - Embedding generation with Hugging Face models
  - Vector store indexing (FAISS, Chroma)
- ✅ Created working RAG pipeline:
  - User query → Retriever → LLM → Final answer
- ✅ Demonstrated Use Case 1: Simple RAG Q&A on sample data (LLaMA3 + A4000 GPU)
- ✅ Explored concepts like memory, temperature, top-p, and prompt engineering
- ✅ Drafted multi-step theoretical insights and notes
- ✅ Visualized working flow (text + image)
